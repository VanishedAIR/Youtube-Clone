After watching an HTML and CSS course, I was able to build a basic semi-functional Youtube clone with HTML, and CSS.

There are definitely places to improve, for example, generating the HTML through JavaScript, having more videos to display on the home page, making the sidebar and header buttons interactive, and customizing it to make it look more like the YouTube we use today.
